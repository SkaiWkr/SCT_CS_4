Basic Keylogger for Educational Purposes

Overview

This project is a simple Python keylogger developed as part of an internship task in the education field. It demonstrates the use of the pynput library to capture and log keystrokes to a file (keylog.txt) with timestamps. The program is designed for learning purposes, showcasing event handling, file I/O, and ethical considerations in software development.

Note: This keylogger is intended for educational use only. Always obtain explicit user consent and adhere to ethical guidelines when working with keylogging software.

Features





Logs keystrokes with timestamps in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.



Handles special keys (e.g., Space, Enter, Tab, Backspace) with clear labels.



Stops logging when the Esc key is pressed.



Writes logs to keylog.txt in the project directory.



Includes error handling to prevent crashes during logging.

Prerequisites





Python 3.x



pynput library (pip install pynput)

Installation





Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/keylogger.git



Navigate to the project directory:

cd keylogger



Install the required library:

pip install pynáƒ¥

Usage





Run the script:

python keylogger.py



Press keys to log them. Special keys are labeled (e.g., "SPACE", "ENTER").



Press Esc to stop the program.



Check keylog.txt for the logged keystrokes.
